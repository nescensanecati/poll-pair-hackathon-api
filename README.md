# Poll-Brothers Website

Poll-Brothers is a Brainstation hackaton project, we worked on this project for only a few hours, approximately from 9am to 4pm on Friday, August 11th. 

The principal objective of this project was to work as a team, compete and win. 

We had to work in pairs to complete as much as needed to make the solution work. 

The work was distributed so every member could complete the same ammount of work for front-end and back-end tasks. 

We had a lot of fun in the sense that everything that could break, broke. We learned as much as we could and we had fun as much as we could.
